Wasn't a productive day. I've been working with c# and .Net for a couple of months now. Dot net is an environment or a framework that provide some services for applications built on it. These services include cryptography, exception handling... etc.
Dot net consists of CLR and class libraries. The courses on LinkedIn learning are cool!

Today, I read **Software Entropy** and the story of **Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs** from the **Pragmatic Programmer book**. The thing I like the most is while reading, I can relate to some situations that I had encountered during work. For example,the story of the broken window reminded me of a stored procedure that was a bit difficult for me as a junior to understand and it was used multiple times. For me it was always complicated and hard to read until it was fixed .This stored procedure could have led to a disaster afterwards .Always remember not to live with the mind set of "I'll just follow what exists" . 

The story of the boiled stones is also brilliant .If I wait for inputs from people around me to do/start sth,I'll wait forever.
