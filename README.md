Dictionary vs Hashtable
The Dictionary is a generic type and that provides type safety and no need for boxing/unboxing.Its implementation is based on the Hashtable.
The Hashtable on the other hand is non-generic so boxing/unboxing is needed.
First time to hear about ConcurrentDictionary.Need to read about it.

Wasn't a productive day. I've been working with c# and .Net for a couple of months now.
Dot net is an environment or a framework that provide some services for applications built on it. These services include cryptography, reading files,connecting to databases.... etc.
Dot net consists of CLR(Common Language Runtime)and FCL (Framework Class Libraries. 
CLR manages my app when it's running. It does things like memory management, garbage collection, Exception handling and it's independent of the operating system and the hardware used.
On the other hand, FCL provides **functionality** to my app.It represent the ready-made functions and libraries that are used in the app.


Side-note :The courses on LinkedIn learning are cool!

Today, I read **Software Entropy** and the story of **Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs** from the **Pragmatic Programmer book**. The thing I like the most is while reading, I can relate to some situations that I had encountered during work. For example,the story of the broken window reminded me of a stored procedure that was a bit difficult for me as a junior to understand and it was used multiple times. For me it was always complicated and hard to read until it was fixed .This stored procedure could have led to a disaster afterwards .Always remember not to live with the mind set of "I'll just follow what exists" . 

The story of the boiled stones is also brilliant .If I wait for inputs from people around me to do/start sth,I'll wait forever.
